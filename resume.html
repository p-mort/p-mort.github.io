        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Dinton Pastures Country Park</h3>
        <p> <b> Sailing Instructor </b> <i> 2020 - present</i> </p>
        <p> 
            I worked at dinton over summers during sixth form and university.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Taught levels 1-4 in the RYA youth scheme, as well as levels 1 and 2, for both teen sailors and adults
            <li> Dealt with a variety of challenges, including adapting teaching to COVID in my first year as an instructor.
            <li> Taught kids with a variety of learning disabilities.
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Sail Birmingham</h3>
        <p> <b> Sailing/Windsurf Instructor </b> <i> 2022 - present</i> </p>
        <p> 
            I worked at Sail Birmingham during term time, augmenting my income while studying.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Helped run weekly sessions for kids, and sessions for schools.
            <li> Taught kids with a variety of learning disabilities and physical using standard and adapted dinghies.
            <li> Ran level 1 and 2 weekend courses for adults, as well as start windsurf courses.
        </ul>
        
        <h3>University of Birmingham</h3>
        <p> <b> Internship Researcher </b> <i> June 2024 - August 2024 </i> </p>
        <p> 
            Between the third and forth years of my undergraduate degree I was offered
            the opportunity to work as a student researcher in the physics department. 
            Over two months I was tasked with performing the preliminary testing and design 
            of a novel, drone-based, gradiometer. I designed a series of experiments to test 
            the basic concept of our design, and was able to measure the motion of a 20kg 
            dumbell in the same room, through gravity alone. I got the opportunity to speak
            at my first conference, and also help with other experiments in the same research group. 
        </p>

        <h3> Student Windsurf Association</h3>
        <p> <b> Treasurer </b> <i> July 2024 - Present </i> </p>
        <p>
            As a student windsurfer, I partook in events run by the SWA (the Student Windsurf Association)
            during my undergraduate degree. I got a huge amount of enjoyment out of these events, so to give 
            back I joined the committee of the SWA as part of their financial team. This was a voluntary role, 
            but gives me experience managing the SWA's finances, organising events and managing transactions 
            with services like Stripe.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
    <b> Piggott School </b> <i> 2014-2019 </i>
    </p>
    <p>
    I went to Piggott for my GCSE's, I got 7's in English, 8's in Computer Science, Physics and Maths and a 9 in chemistry. 
    </p>
    <p><b> Piggott School Sixth Form </b> <i> 2019-2021 </i></p>
    <p>
    I went to Piggott Sixth form, near Reading. I acheived A*A*A in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. I greatly enjoyed my time at Piggot despite having to deal with a large number of challenges, 
    in paticular COVID. During my time at the college, I had a chance to engage in lots of extra curicular activities. I went to open days, helped out in Maths Classes, became a physics prefect, 
    and ran a series of Maths Masterclasses for young mathematicians from nearby schools. Topics Included: Knot theory, geometry and pulleys/moments. All taught around the story of bank heist.
    </p>
    <p><b> University of Birmingham </b> <i> 2021-2025 </i></p>
    <p> I am currently studying for an integrated Masters course in Physics and the University of Birmingham. In my course I have developed my skills in programming, problem solving and a variety of experimental techniques.
        I have studied modules in condensed matter (electrical and conductive properties of solids), numerical methods, complex analysis and Relativity (both special and general). To support my studies I worked part time as
        a sailing/windsurf instructor at Midlands Sailing Club, balancing my studies and work was a rewarding challenge. In addition I spent two years on committee for the UOB windsurf club (as traing sec, and then as president)
        both running the society and coaching others to windsurf.

    <h2> Interests/Hobbies </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> I am a keen windsurfer, and windsurf at least once a week, I enjoy going on occasional trips to windsurf around the country. I have built up a lot of safety boat confidence by providing safety cover on these trips.
        <li> I still enjoy sailing, and will occasionally take out a laser to race.
        <li> I enjoy a bit of climbing, and enjoy bouldering with friends at our local centre.
        <li> I am a keen swimmer, and swim almost every day, primarily for fitness.
        <li> I also organise walking trips with my friends, typically for a week at a time, walking from campsite to campsite with all our gear.
        <li> Finally, I am a keen pianist, playing to a diploma level.
