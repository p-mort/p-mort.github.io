    <p>
    <b> Piggott School </b> <i> 2014-2019 </i>
    </p>
    <p>
    I went to Piggott for my GCSE's, I got 7's in English, 8's in Computer Science, Physics and Maths and a nine in chemistry. 
    </p>
    <p><b> Piggott School Sixth Form </b> <i> 2019-2021 </i></p>
    <p>
    I went to Piggott Sixth form, near Reading. I acheived A*A*A in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. I greatly enjoyed my time at Piggot despite having to deal with a large number of challenges, 
    in paticular COVID. During my time at the college, I had a chance to engage in lots of extra curicular activities. I went to open days, helped out in Maths Classes, became a physics prefect, 
    and ran a series of Maths Masterclasses for young mathematicians from nearby schools. Topics Included: Knot theory, geometry and pulleys/moments. All taught around the story of bank heist.
    </p>
    <p><b> University of Birmingham </b> <i> 2021-2025 </i></p>
    <p> I am currently studying for an integrated Masters course in Physics and the University of Birmingham. In my course I have developed my skills in programming, problem solving and a variety of experimental techniques.
        I have studied modules in condensed matter (electrical and conductive properties of solids), numerical methods, complex analysis and Relativity (both special and general). To support my studies I worked part time as
        a sailing/windsurf instructor at Midlands Sailing Club, balancing my studies and work was a rewarding challenge. In addition I spent two years on committee for the UOB windsurf club (as traing sec, and then as president)
        both running the society and coaching others to windsurf.
